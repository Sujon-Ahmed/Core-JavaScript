JavaScript History
-----------------------
In early 1995, Brendan Eich from Netscape, took charge of design and implementation of a new language for non-java programmers to give access of newly added Java support in Netscape navigator.

Eich eventually decided that a loosely-typed scripting language suited the environment and audience, web designers and developers who needed to be able to tie into page elements (such as forms, or frames, or images) without a bytecode compiler or knowledge of object-oriented software design. The dynamic nature of the language led to it being named "LiveScript" but was quickly renamed to "JavaScript" Know more about JavaScript history.
