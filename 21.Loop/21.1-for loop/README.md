For Loop
---------
The for loop is frequently used, usually where the loop will be traversed a fixed number of times.
Syntax:-
    for(initialization; test condition; increment or decrement)
        {
            block of statements;
        }


    for(initialization; test condition; increment or decrement)
        {
            block of statements;
        }

    for(i=0; i<5; i++)
        {
            document.write(i);
        }
